## Functional requirements

This project will provide a game live stream service accessible by everyone with a web browser.  With the use of 3rd party
broadcast software, streamers will be able to distribute their content to their audience. The service is free to use for
everyone, where registered users either stream content or watch other users. Streamers will have the option to save previously
recorded streams on their own page for users to watch later. The service works both while being signed in or not. Extra functionality 
is provided for users signed in, such as live chat and feed customization. Users will be able to follow other users and get notified
when streamers are live.
